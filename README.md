# High-Altitude Global Ballooning System

The code in this repository was used in the Michigan Exploration Laboratory's High-Altitude Global Ballooning System (HAGBS), which I worked on as part of my AE 405 project during the Fall 2019 semester at the University of Michigan. It ran on a custom PCB board based on the Tracksoar APRS tracker, from which the code base is also derived.
