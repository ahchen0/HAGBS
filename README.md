This repository contains all of the code for the F19 AERO405 High-Altitude 
Global Ballooning System (HA-GBS). 

The initial code in this repo has been sourced from the TrackSoar's open-
source code base for the TrackSoar-v1.1

We have begun to change it to be able to accomodate payloads and format packets 
accordingly.
